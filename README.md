# Weather App [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/LICENSE)

A weather app written in JavaScript with a completely Model-View-Controller Architecture. There are two ways to fetch weather data:

-   By writing the city name in the specified input element and clicking the Search button (Enter key works the same way),
-   By clicking the small satellite icon, which represents geolocation, this method fetches your device's location using the Geolocation API, a built-in JavaScript feature. It then checks the weather for the city corresponding to your coordinates.

The Weather App uses the Parcel NPM module. The compiled and ready-to-use files are located in the "public" git branch. The source code of this project can be found in the src folder.
